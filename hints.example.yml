  ## Core Game Rules for Optimal Performance

  **Game Objective:**
  - Transform the key to match the exit door pattern, then touch the exit door to win
  - The key is a 6x6 square in bottom-left corner, exit door is 4x4 with gray border

  **Movement & Actions:**
  - Move in 4 cardinal directions only (up, down, left, right)
  - Each movement advances 4 blocks
  - Only movement actions are available - no other interactions

  **Key Objects:**
  - **Rotator (3x3 object)**: Touch to rotate key pattern until it matches exit door
  - **Refiller (2x2 object)**: Touch to refill energy when low
  - **Lives**: 3 lives total with 25 energy each, shown in top-right
  - **Walls**: Cannot move through green elements (INT<10)

  **Strategy Guidelines:**
  - Thoroughly explore the entire environment before acting
  - Think about object positions relative to player before each action
  - If actions repeatedly fail, try different approaches
  - Monitor energy levels - refill when low to avoid losing lives
  - Always think before acting and adjust strategy if plans fail

  **Critical Constraints:**
  - Energy depletes with actions, lose life when energy runs out
  - Cannot move through walls or non-walkable areas
  - Key must visually match exit door's central pattern to win
